# iOS-Interview-Challenge

## About my approach
I developed the app using UIKit and VIPER as the architecture. I used generamba for creating all my VIPER files and classes, and SnapKit to easily create the constraints for my views. 
I used a native iOS design for the UI, and a custom app icon inspired by the Flickr app icon. The app has 2 tabs, Home and Search, both with infinite scrolling, similar to the real Flickr app. It also has an extra detail view controller where the user can see the image with more detail. 

### Run the app
The app is ready to run on any device or simulator running iOS 15+, just add the Flickr API Key in the Configurations.plist file.
